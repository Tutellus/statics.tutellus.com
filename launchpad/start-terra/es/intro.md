StarTerra is turning the Launchpad space upside down with its gamification of how funds for projects launching are raised and distributed amongst the public, community members and blockchain investors. Gamification of the IDO process also includes the integration of Play2Earn, where top scorers on our leaderboards receive payouts in $UST, as well as NFT Integration, which allow players to customize their avatars and gain an edge in leaderboard scoring.

Additionally StarTerra aims to revolutionize Post-IDO marketing and support through Multi-Planetary-Farming, an innovative feature that will be a first of its kind in the IDO space. StarTerra aims to bring top quality projects to investors in the Terra Ecosystem, and eventually all of blockchain. Our Roadmap consists of not yet announced features that will continue the evolution of StarTerra towards being the premier launchpad in all of crypto.

STT Post-TGE IDO will be the first of its kind, where StarTerra tokens are sold at Public Sale/listing price of $0.14.
