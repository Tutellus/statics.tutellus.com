We check that up to 100 units sold the price remains up to $ 1,000 per token; Unit #150 will already reach a price of $7,700 and from token #200 the price shoots up above $30,000. It must be remembered that the contract will always be available and with liquidity to be able to buy tokens, so it will be very interesting to monitor the model and its results.

The important thing is to analyze the tokenomic model, the liquidity of the contract and the number of operations that can be done each month. In this way, the user can benefit from the increase in the price of the token as its demand increases, and the first buyers will have bought at a tremendously competitive price.

In short, the POEM token represents a full-fledged social experiment: as it is the first tokenization by NFT of a book of poetry in the world, we will see in the coming months how the token is capable of absorbing value and how the model evolves from the prospect of financing other similar projects. It is, without a doubt, an exciting world that can mark the genesis of many future tokenizations.
