The objective therefore of the La Fundación is to unify the world of technology mathematics, with the world of poetry, through cryptographic transactions, safe and immutable, which facilitates the global dissemination of poetry. In our opinion, both worlds, poetry and mathematics, share beauty and truth.

The first token issued corresponds to the book "_Los trabajos de la muerte_", by Jorge Dot. This token is called POEM. It is a non-fungible token (NFT), indivisible, and that establishes a direct and unique relationship between the corresponding books. 250 tokens are created for 250 unique books.

The possession of the token implies the right to obtain the physical book in exchange for the token, as well as access to the entire digital content of the book, for reading. The physical book will be deposited and guarded by La Fundación, or it will be printed at the moment in which the owner of the token decides to exchange it for the physical book (redeem it). La Fundación will send the physical book to the postal address provided by the owner of the token, who has decided to redeem said token, and the token will be destroyed.
