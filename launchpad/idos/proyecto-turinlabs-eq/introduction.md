**Connecting products, needs and people through Bitcoin.**

From TurinLabs, we believe that decentralization helps the world and lets people be free. Our products are aligned with this vision getting people and companies closer with Bitcoin in a simple way.

**TurinWallet** is a mobile APP to buy, receive and send instant bitcoin payments designed for muggles.

**TurinPay** is a full API solution to let merchants (off and online) receive bitcoin payments in real-time, and for free.

**TurinPool** is an AMM built over the Polygon network and focused on security/equity tokens. A new way to bring liquidity to your company.

Weâ€™ll develop these and new products and improve the actual ones, always aligned with our mission.
