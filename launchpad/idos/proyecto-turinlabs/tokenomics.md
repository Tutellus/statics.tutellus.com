The TURIN token is a utility token: it represents the access to the companyâ€™s products with more advantages for users, such as paying lower fees, getting rewarded through marketing actions, letting access to certain functionalities and so on.

### 1. Main innovations.

Most of the projects generate a tokenomics model that just looks like copied and pasted. _From TurinLabs we cannot do the same shit._ So after two years of developing products we now present a tokenomics model really interesting, attending to the following innovations:

- We generate only a public sale, through the Tutellus Launchpad. There won't be ICO or private sales to anyone. Never.
- We introduce a new term to sale part of the tokens: **PSDA (Public Sale Daily Auction)**: a smart contract will issue every day at the same hour/block a new bundle of $TURIN tokens, being able to be bought only along these 24 hours. Tokens that are not sold will be burnt. We'll detail it later.
- We create a small token supply, just 21 million (God bless Satoshi!), and decreasing because of the potential burning rate of not sold tokens in the PSDA.
- We are not worried about the low marketcap the full project has in the preLaunch stage ($2.1MM): it's really cheap, but it is designed to capture value quickly.

### 2. Distribution.

| Stakeholder | Quantity   | Percentage |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Launchpad   | 4,250,000  | 20%        |
| PSDA        | 6,250,000  | 30%        |
| Team        | 3,150,000  | 15%        |
| Treasury    | 3,150,000  | 15%        |
| Rewards     | 1,050,000  | 5%         |
| Incentives  | 3,150,000  | 15%        |
| Total       | 21,000,000 | 100%       |

### 3. PSDA

The **Public Sale Daily Auction** is a new concept to issue tokens in fair conditions for everyone, avoiding some very uncomfortable aspects of big sales:

- Big investors are always benefited from higher discounts or better conditions without public visibility.
- The moment of issuing is always concerned about the market conditions: in bear or lateral markets, big sales don't happen.
- The main beneficiary of the big sale is always the company, never the protocol or the community. It's fine and there's a company (TurinLabs) under the #TURIN token, but what about if we could make things different?

So the PSDA is a smart contract that generates a daily auction of 5.800 tokens, every day and for 3 years so that investors can bid for these tokens in charge of USDT. The first investor gets the auction. If no investors get the auction in this period, tokens are burnt.

There are a lot of advantages to the PSDA:

- There's no slippage, so for "big" quantities you can go to the PSDA contract instead of the liquidity pool.
- There's no option to take more or fewer tokens: just 5.800 each day and every day. _This is the way_.
- Supply will always be less than 21 million, due to some auctions could be empty. If all auctions were sold it would also be a very good scenario for the protocol, because of the next point.
- No pump&down or rug pull strategies are possible in the way the token is distributed progressively and there's no vault with most of the assets.
- Turin Labs can use the funds received (USDT) to buy $TURIN tokens to the pool, to buy WBTC to farm or invest in the company. But surely it can help to pump the token price.
- This full strategy drives the $TURIN token to empower the community and the token release over time, staying it decentralized and in community hands at +76% in 48 months (in the worst scenario, where the Team and Treasury hold all their tokens);
