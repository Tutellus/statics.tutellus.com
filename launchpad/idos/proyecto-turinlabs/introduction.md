From TurinLabs, we believe decentralization helps the world and lets people be free. Our products are aligned with this vision getting people and companies closer to crypto in a simple way.

The TURIN token will be used in all our products as a way to get more benefits: to pay fewer fees or to access unique functionalities. Let’s review our products;

**[TurinWallet](https://www.turinlabs.com/turinwallet)** is a mobile app designed for muggles to buy, receive and send instant bitcoin payments. The product holds your BTC in a stablecoin (e€ or e$) to prevent volatility, and includes an on-ramp solution from fiat: you can charge your wallet with your credit/debit card or from other Bitcoin/LN wallet.
