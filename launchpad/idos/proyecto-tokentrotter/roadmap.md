TokenTrotter is very aware of its mission; to help people have fun and educate themselves while travelling. Generate emotions and give people and families a way to keep an indelible memory of their trips as well as give them rewards as they travel.

We intend to **promote culture** and bring it closer to all people wherever they are. Thinking of those people who, for whatever reason, cannot travel, we propose the development of a **metaverse through the use of Virtual Reality (VR).**

Thus, after completing the roadmap and stabilizing the application and its economy, TokenTrotter will begin the construction of a gamified metaverse where, through VR, the user **will be able to access all our content remotely**, as if they were really visiting the city.

Audio guides, fun challenges and games that will test your knowledge of the cities and where you can find **interesting prizes and hidden treasures.**
