Since the beginning of the pandemic, travelling is becoming **more expensive and complicated**, and it’s increasingly difficult for businesses that live from tourism to survive.

As a **tourist**, as the offer of different places increases, it becomes more difficult to optimize your time travelling around a new city. It’s quite difficult to **discover the correct spots** depending on your travel preferences and find the right tours, museums, events, restaurants, pubs, theatres, concerts, etc.

A lot of other travelling applications exist, but the lack of good and updated content is the main reason for their failure. None of them is supported by an **involved** **community**, receive feedback, additional content, customized experiences or offers gamified experiences or rewards. This obsolete business model is not scalable as it’s very **expensive** to provide good content without having an active community behind it. Searching for every secret spot, updating information, and creating new entertaining opportunities is time-consuming and not attractive **if you are not rewarded for it**.

As a tourism-related **business**, as our competition increases, optimizing the success rate of new advertising campaigns is becoming more necessary. The **extra cost** added by the intermediaries is also a known problem.

We are overprotected by governments and banks as we are **not custodians of our own assets.** However, the entry barriers into the crypto world are huge for people who are less familiar with new technology. Having to backup private keys is still something strange for many people, not to mention using decentralized exchanges and DeFi protocols.

Connecting our two great passions, **travelling and crypto-economics**, we decided to find the optimal financial formula to tackle these problems, we then started looking for a way to **generate revenue while travelling**. Looking at the ecosystem, the success of Game2Earn gave us the light.
