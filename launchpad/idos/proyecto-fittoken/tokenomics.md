The tokens associated with the promoter team remain locked for 20 months and are
distributed progressively over the next 100 months.

The rest of the tokens are distributed from month 1, the fastest being those sold in pre-sale.
Yield farming refers to the incentives for staking and farming.

The customer incentive pool will be used to pay SlowFit customers, but the tokens delivered
monthly will be bought and burned. Unused tokens will be partly burned and partly kept in a
wallet in order to continue staking/farming incentives after the 70 months of incentives have
expired.

Once the 120 months of customer incentives have expired, the tokens must be purchased
directly from the liquidity pool or from any exchange where the token is listed in order to be
used as Slowfit and Resistance Institute incentives.

Centres that join tokenization with FITtoken, must purchase the tokens in the pancake pool
or in the exchanges where they are listed, in order to be able to distribute them to their clients
as incentives.
