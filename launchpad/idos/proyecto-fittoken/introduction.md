FITtoken gives access to unique functionalities, both in the centres that use it through crypto marketing, as well as independently through DeFi services. Therefore, any customer of the companies that use it or crypto-believer will be able to benefit from this unique token, with sustained incentives over the long term that will inevitably cause the token to absorb value.

The FITtoken went on private sale to people close to the company or its entourage in April 2021, to go live progressively with internal and external services during July 2021.
