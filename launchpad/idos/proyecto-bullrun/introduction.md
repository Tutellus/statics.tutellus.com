The $BULL token is a security token. It is the representation of the debt issued on the film and gives certain rights to the profits of the film. 50% of the film's net income is distributed in the form of payments in USDT every 3 months. The other 50% is included in a DeFi operation on stablecoins and represents the liquidated value of the $BULL token at any time until the token is self-liquidated in 2025 and distributes the profits of 4 years among the token holders equally.
