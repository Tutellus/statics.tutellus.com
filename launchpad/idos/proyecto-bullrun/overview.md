Ana is a filmmaker who gets into cryptocurrency trading during the pandemic. Her husband (who is about to become an ex-husband) gets her to go to a psychologist (deceived). Ana decides, as an exercise in reparation (in order to continue trading in peace), to make a documentary about the bitcoin fever and the crypto world.

Ana's story will serve as a Trojan horse to enter the crypto ecosystem through expert testimonials. We will discover why the blockchain is the most important technological revolution since the internet. This documentary-comedy will infiltrate the minds of the swindlers, deniers, geeks, engineers, anarchists, billionaires, utopian capitalists and millennials who dominate the market, where what is really at stake is the future.

$BULL is the film token that is gonna be described, a film called “BullRun”.
