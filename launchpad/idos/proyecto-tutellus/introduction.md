The TUT is being used by thousands of people who learn, teach and interact in Tutellus platform and ecosystem. You use the TUT to access products and services, and you earn TUTs by interacting with the community and protocol.

The TUT can be used by students, teachers, entrepreneurs, holders and project supporters. But not only it will be used in Tutellus: we are working to spread it across all the educational sectors to be used by any University in the world: no costs, no investments, no fees: they will use our smart contracts and will buy the TUT tokens they need for their students (TUT Whitelabel).

The goal of the business model is to empower people through the TUT token, letting them capture value from different sources and to being benefited all kinds of players (stakeholders).

So stakeholders and entities in the Tutellus ecosystem are:

- **Students**: they pay for learning and earn tokens depending on two factors:
   - The money they invested (as payback, [rewards here](https://www.notion.so/tutellus/whitepaper/8.-rewards-in-tutellus-1)).
   - The interaction and contribution they produce inside the platform.
- **Teachers**: they earn money selling content, and can hire different services (like SEM and promotion) only in tokens ([services here](https://www.notion.so/tutellus/whitepaper/7.-teacher-services)).
- **TUT whitelabel**: third parties who can implement their own tokens based on the TUT liquidity (such as Universities or any kind of company willing to tokenize their incentive system).
- **Startups**: projects born around Tutellus who need to raise funds. They can do it through the Launchpad service ([here](https://www.notion.so/tutellus/products/launchpad)).
- **LPs / Liquidity providers**: holders who reinforce the protocol by adding liquidity (TUT+WBTC in a 50-50) in the farming pool ([here](https://www.notion.so/tutellus/products/farming-pool)).
