### 1. Goals.

The TUT tokenomics have been designed and set following our [philosophy](https://www.notion.so/tutellus/whitepaper/tut-philosophy). We are putting together:

- The rewards to all holders that bet for the **TUT in 2017**. During this time we added tokens to their wallets for the proved patience.
- A **new token supply**, reducing it 7.5x: from 1.5b (2017) to 200m (2021).
- A more **decentralized token distribution**: 77% of all tokens are allocated to yield farming and rewards.
- An **absolute bet for the community**: only 3% of tokens are allocated for the team, with 9 months vesting and with no option to participate in yield farming initial programs.
- A **progressive token release,** where the community will receive their tokens first and will have _privileges_ over any other stakeholder on getting rewarded, by contributing to the protocol and accumulating TUT.

Token holders from the 2017 TUT and 2021 TUT private sale are the first groups to get the tokens, as well as Tutellus users and clients as rewards for their interaction with the platform.

The core team will start getting their tokens from month 9 and Tutellus Treasury will have a slower and progressive distribution, even after the yield farming is over, for 60 months.
