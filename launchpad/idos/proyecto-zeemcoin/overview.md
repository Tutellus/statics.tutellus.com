Zeemcoin is the first tokenized platform in the e-Mobility sector that, through its mobile app and its community of electric car drivers, collects data on the public charging experience, such as the quality of chargers and the services offered around the European charger network.

This information helps improve the user's experience when recharging their car on public roads and consequently drives the adoption of the electric vehicle, gradually moving us closer to a future with emission-free transportation.

The EV drivers community will contribute to generate Big Data using a Gamification Module integrated into the Zeemcoin App and will get rewards in form of $ZEEM tokens. Our token will become the standard for EV charging payment in Europe and drivers will benefit from this massive adoption. Industry players will adopt this digital payment to help in this race to a zero-emission future.
