Zeemcoin mobile APP includes the following modules and solutions:

**Reward Center:** The Reward Center is where drivers receive $ZEEM tokens and can buy products and services related to the eMobility industry and other sustainable options.

**Quality Big Data Module:** Our Quality Big Data Module system uses gamification to generate Big Data from electric vehicle drivers who provide feedback about the charging stations and the services around them. These Big Data Reports will improve EV Infrastructure across Europe. This information is used by CPOs (Charge Point Operators) and other players to improve their customer experience.

**Sustainable Module:** You will be able to offset you carbon footprint, plant trees, create NFTs and much more ;-)

**Road Trip Planner:** Will intelligently propose the best available route for a trip, taking into account all the refined information of the charging infrastructure, as the drivers will report incidents of the chargers that the system will take it into account (similar to Waze with accidents or traffic jams).

**Advertising Module:** As we know where drivers will stop and for how much time, we will provide them with adds during the trip. The driver will receive rewards in $ZEEM tokens for the impacts as Brave/VAT Model.

# Business Flow

EV Drivers use Zeemcoin APP to find and review European CPOs chargers, we can show their chargers in our APP because we use roaming platforms and direct integrations with the main players.

Data generated by EV Drivers goes to Zeemcoin Quality Big Data Module where it is processed and sold via APIs, instant notifications, interactive dashboards, monthly reports or ad hoc reports to Zeemcoin, which is the main business at the short term.

EV Drivers receive Zeemcoin tokens in reward for evaluating chargers. For each charger they evaluate they will receive a maximum of 5.6 Zeemcoin tokens as a reward. The more information about the charger the user provides, the greater the reward he/she will receive.

EV Drivers can evaluate a charger and earn rewards every 12 hours.
